    "In the era of data-driven decision-making, the ability to query databases efficiently and accurately is important. However, not everyone is proficient in SQL. This is where Text-to-SQL comes in. Text-to-SQL systems enable users to interact with databases using natural language, making data querying accessible to a broader audience. \n",

    "In this notebook, we will explore how Text-to-SQL pipeline is designed to work and how we can somewhat optimize the conversion of langauge questions into SQL queries using Large Language Models. By the end of the article, we will have a good understanding of how Text-to-SQL works and how they can transform the way we interact with data. \n",

    "The `optimize_query` method refines the generated natural language questions to make them more suitable for SQL conversion. \n",

    "**Here are some key reasons why this optimization step is important**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Improving Clarity and Precisions\n",
    "    - Natural Language questions can often be ambiguous or imprecise. The optimization process helps to clarify the intent of the question and ensures that it is specific enough to be accurately converted into an SQL query. This reduces the chances of generating incorrect or inefficient SQL code\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Maintaining Context and Relevance\n",
    "    - The optimization process takes into account table descriptions and schema ensuring that the questions remain relevnat to the database structure. This helps maintain the context and ensures that the generated SQL queries are meaningful and aligned with available data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "Natural Language Question: \"Show me the total sales for each month this year.\"\n",
    "Without Optimization, the resulting SQL query might look like\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "    SELECT \n",
    "        month, \n",
    "        SUM(sales) \n",
    "    FROM \n",
    "        orders \n",
    "    WHERE \n",
    "        order_time >= '2025-01-01' \n",
    "    GROUP BY \n",
    "        month;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Potential Issues:\n",
    "- the column `month` might not exist directly in the orders table\n",
    "- the date filter might not be correctly aligned with the current year\n",
    "- the table name might not include the correct schema prefix\n",
    "\n",
    "With Optimization, the natural language query can be translated to: \"Calculate the sum of net_sales from daily_sales table, grouped by extract(month from date) where date >= '2024-01-01' and date <= '2024-12-31'\". Resulting to a better SQL generated code\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "    SELECT \n",
    "        EXTRACT(MONTH FROM order_time) AS month,\n",
    "        SUM(total_sales) AS total_sales\n",
    "    FROM \n",
    "        gold.orders \n",

    "- The DATE_TRUNC('year', CURRENT_DATE) function ensures that the date filter is aligned with the current year.\n",
