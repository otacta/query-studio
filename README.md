# Otacta QueryStudio

## Overview
Otacta QueryStudio is a freemium tool designed to streamline the process of converting natural language (NL) queries into SQL commands. The tool incorporates advanced AI features, including Chain-of-Thought (COT) reasoning, human-in-the-loop validation, and synthetic query generation, enabling developers and data scientists to efficiently create, validate, and deploy SQL queries with transparency and precision.

### Key Features
- **Natural Language to SQL Automation**: Effortlessly converts user-friendly NL queries into SQL code.
- **Chain-of-Thought Reasoning**: Provides logical explanations for SQL generation, enhancing transparency and learning.
- **Human-in-the-Loop Validation**: Ensures accuracy and user oversight at key stages, including SQL validation and testing.
- **Synthetic Query Generation**: Produces diverse query sets (up to 100x) to improve robustness.
- **Seamless Integration**: Acts as the backbone for text-to-SQL workflows, centralizing key processes.

### Objectives
1. Automate the translation of NL queries into SQL.
2. Enhance the accuracy and diversity of query generation.
3. Provide detailed reasoning and validation mechanisms for SQL creation.
4. Create an end-to-end workflow that combines AI-driven processes with human validation.

# Version Control Workflows

## Branching Strategy
- **Main Branch**: Contains production-ready code.
- **Development Branch**: Used for integrating features before merging to the main branch.
- **Feature Branches**: Each feature or bugfix should have its own branch, following the naming convention `feature/<feature-name>` or `bugfix/<bug-name>`.

### Workflow:
1. Create a branch from `development`: 
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/<feature-name> development
   ```
2. Commit changes locally and push the branch:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/<feature-name>
   ```
3. Open a pull request from your branch to `development`.

## Pull Requests
- Include a detailed description of your changes.
- Assign reviewers and include any relevant documentation.
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting the pull request.

## Issue Tracking
- Use GitHub Issues for tracking bugs, features, and improvements.
- Tag issues with appropriate labels (e.g., `bug`, `enhancement`, `documentation`).
- Assign issues to team members for accountability.
